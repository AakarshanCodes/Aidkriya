# Phase 3 - Collaboration Workflow & Feature Development

## üìã Overview
Based on the aidKRIYA Walker Platform specifications, we need to complete Phase 3 with proper collaboration setup and continue building features.

## üåø Step 1: Create Git Branches for Collaboration

### Branch Structure:
```
main (production-ready code)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/gps-tracking (Person A)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/matching-algorithm (Person B)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/payment-rating (Person C)
```

### Commands to Execute:
```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd flutter_application_1

# Check current status
git status

# Create branches for each team member
git checkout -b feature/gps-tracking
git checkout -b feature/matching-algorithm
git checkout -b feature/payment-rating

# Go back to main
git checkout main
```

## üì± Step 2: Key Features to Implement

### 1. GPS Tracking & Real-time Location
**Branch:** `feature/gps-tracking`
**Status:** Ready to implement

**What's needed:**
- ‚úÖ Google Maps already in `pubspec.yaml`
- ‚úÖ Geolocator package already added
- Need: Real-time location tracking screen
- Need: Show both Wanderer and Walker locations
- Need: Update location every 5-10 seconds during walk

**Files to create:**
- `lib/screens/live_walk_screen.dart` - Show both users on map
- `lib/services/location_service.dart` - Handle GPS updates
- Update `walk_service.dart` to store location updates

### 2. Advanced Matching Algorithm
**Branch:** `feature/matching-algorithm`
**Status:** Basic matching exists, needs enhancement

**What's needed:**
- Matching based on:
  - Location proximity
  - Available Walkers
  - Walker ratings
  - Pace preferences
  - Interests matching

**Files to update:**
- `lib/services/matching_service.dart` (create new)
- Update `WalkService` with matching logic

### 3. SOS & Emergency Features
**Branch:** `feature/payment-rating`
**Status:** Not implemented

**What's needed:**
- Emergency button on active walk screen
- Auto-send location to emergency contacts
- Alert authorities option
- Shake-to-alert feature

**Files to create:**
- `lib/screens/sos_screen.dart`
- `lib/services/emergency_service.dart`

### 4. Payment & Rating System
**Branch:** `feature/payment-rating`
**Status:** Basic rating exists, payment missing

**What's needed:**
- 25% commission calculation (already in WalkService)
- Payment gateway integration
- Post-walk rating system
- Review submission

**Files to create/update:**
- `lib/screens/payment_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/review_screen.dart` (already exists, enhance)
- Integrate Razorpay (commented in pubspec.yaml)

### 5. Walk History & Management
**Status:** Partially implemented

**What's needed:**
- Walk history screen for both roles
- Filter by status (completed, cancelled, upcoming)
- Show ratings and reviews
- Earnings view for Walkers

**Files to create:**
- `lib/screens/walk_history_screen.dart`

## üéØ Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented:
1. User authentication (email/password + Google)
2. User profiles (Walker/Wanderer roles)
3. Basic walk request creation
4. Walk request acceptance
5. Walk status management
6. Location input (manual)
7. Pace and interest preferences
8. Commission calculation (25%)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented:
1. Walk tracking (models exist, UI missing)
2. Rating system (backend ready, UI basic)
3. Walk history (stream exists, UI basic)

### ‚ùå Missing Features:
1. GPS real-time tracking during walk
2. Map integration showing user locations
3. SOS emergency features
4. Payment gateway integration
5. Advanced matching algorithm
6. Walk history UI with filters
7. Background checks workflow
8. Comprehensive walk status UI

## üöÄ Phase 3 Action Plan

### Day 1 - Setup & GPS Tracking
```powershell
# Person A: GPS Tracking
git checkout feature/gps-tracking
# Implement location_service.dart
# Create live_walk_screen.dart
# Test real-time tracking
git commit -m "feat: Add GPS tracking and live walk screen"
```

### Day 1-2 - Matching Algorithm
```powershell
# Person B: Matching
git checkout feature/matching-algorithm  
# Create matching_service.dart
# Implement location-based matching
# Add rating-weighted matching
git commit -m "feat: Add intelligent walk matching algorithm"
```

### Day 2 - Payment & Rating
```powershell
# Person C: Payment & Rating
git checkout feature/payment-rating
# Integrate Razorpay
# Enhance review_screen.dart
# Add payment confirmation
git commit -m "feat: Add payment gateway and enhanced rating"
```

### Day 2-3 - Merge & Test
```powershell
# Merge branches
git checkout main
git merge feature/gps-tracking
git merge feature/matching-algorithm
git merge feature/payment-rating

# Test everything
flutter test
flutter run
```

## üìù Team Workflow

### Each team member should:
1. Pull latest changes before starting work
2. Create their feature branch
3. Implement their feature
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit with descriptive messages
6. Create Pull Request
7. Review each other's code before merging

### Good Commit Messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add GPS tracking service"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve location permission issue"
git commit -m "refactor: Improve walk matching algorithm"
```

## üé® UI/UX Improvements Needed

### Priority 1 (Essential):
1. **Live Walk Screen**
   - Map showing both users
   - Real-time location updates
   - Duration timer
   - Distance tracker
   - End walk button

2. **Walk History**
   - List of all past walks
   - Filter by status
   - Show ratings and reviews
   - Earnings summary for Walkers

3. **Enhanced Profile**

   - Auto-refresh available

### Priority 3 (Nice to have):
6. **Dashboard Stats**
   - Total earnings
   - Completed walks
   - Average rating
   - Weekly/monthly graphs
