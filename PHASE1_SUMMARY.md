# Phase 1: Setup & Core User Features - COMPLETE ✅

## What Has Been Built

Phase 1 of AIDkriya is now complete! Here's what you have:

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Email/Password Authentication**: Full signup and login with validation
- **Google Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Google
- **Role Selection**: Users can choose to be a "Walker" or "Wanderer" during signup
- **Secure Firebase Integration**: All authentication handled by Firebase Auth

### 👤 User Profile System  
- **Two User Roles**: 
  - **Walker**: People who provide walking companionship
  - **Wanderer**: People looking for someone to walk with
- **Profile Fields**: Name, email, photo, bio, verification status
- **Role-Specific Fields**: 
  - Walker: location, pace, interests, hourly rate, ratings
  - Wanderer: emergency contact info
- **Cloud Firestore Database**: All profiles stored securely

### 🎨 Beautiful UI Screens
1. **Login Screen** - Clean design with email/password and Google options
2. **Signup Screen** - Role selection with validation
3. **Home Screen** - Role-based content for Walkers and Wanderers
4. **Profile Screen** - Beautiful profile display with all user information

### 📦 Firebase Services
- `AuthService`: Handles all authentication operations
- `FirestoreService`: Manages user profile database operations
- Fully integrated with your Firebase project (aidkriya-294dc)
