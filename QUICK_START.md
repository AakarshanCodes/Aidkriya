# AIDkriya - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Working Right Now

### 1. Email/Password Authentication
- ✅ Sign up with email/password
- ✅ Login with email/password
- ✅ User profiles (Walker/Wanderer)
- ✅ Profile saved to Firestore
- ✅ Role-based UI

### 2. Google Sign-In
- ⚠️ Needs configuration (see below)
- ✅ You can skip it for now!

## 🚀 How to Test Right Now

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Enter your name, email, password
3. Choose your role (Walker or Wanderer)
4. Sign up!
5. You're in! Check your profile.

## 📱 What You Can Do

### As a Walker:
- Your home screen shows profile editing options
- You can view your profile

### As a Wanderer:
- Your home screen shows "Walk Now" and "Schedule Walk" options
- (These are placeholders for Phase 2)

## 🔧 Google Sign-In Issue

**The Error**: Google Sign-In shows "ClientID not set"

**The Solution**: 
1. See `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md` for full setup
2. Or just use email/password (works perfectly!)
3. Skip Google Sign-In for now

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Continue Testing Phase 1 ✅
- Test all authentication flows
- Create multiple accounts
- Check Firestore database

### Option 2: Move to Phase 2 🚶‍♀️
- Build walk request system
- Add "Walk Now" functionality
- Create Walker matching

### Option 3: Fix Google Sign-In 🔧
- Follow `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md`
- Configure OAuth client ID
- Test Google Sign-In

## 📋 Recommended Path

1. **Test email/password** - verify it works ✅
2. **Check profiles in Firestore** - see your data ✅
3. **Build Phase 2** - add walk requests 🚀
4. **Setup Google Sign-In later** (optional)

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Flutter not found"
- Make sure Flutter is installed and in your PATH
- Or use your IDE to run the app

### "Build failed"
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### "Google Sign-In error"
- Just use email/password instead!
- Or follow `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md`

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For Competition**: Email/password is enough for the demo
2. **Google Sign-In**: Nice to have, but not required
3. **Firebase Console**: Check it to see your data
4. **Hot Reload**: Use `r` in terminal for quick testing
