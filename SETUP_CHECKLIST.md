# ‚úÖ Setup Checklist - GPS Tracking Feature

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd C:\Users\aakar\AIDkriya\flutter_application_1
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Add Google Maps API Key

**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Find this section and add your API key:
```xml
<application>
    <!-- Add this before the closing </application> tag -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"/>
</application>
```

**How to get Google Maps API Key:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project (or create new)
3. Enable "Maps SDK for Android"
4. Create API Key in "Credentials"
5. Copy the key and paste above

### 3. Test Location Services

**On Device:**
1. Enable location services on your Android device
2. Grant location permissions when prompted
3. Test walk acceptance flow
4. Verify GPS tracking works

## ‚úÖ Already Complete

- ‚úÖ Location permissions added to AndroidManifest.xml
- ‚úÖ Permission handler package added
- ‚úÖ GPS tracking service created

## üéØ Next Features to Add

### For Team Member A (GPS Tracking):
- [x] Location service ‚úÖ
- [x] Live walk screen ‚úÖ
- [ ] Test on actual device
- [ ] Add location update interval settings

### For Team Member B (Matching Algorithm):
- [ ] Create proximity-based matching
- [ ] Filter by Walker availability
- [ ] Add rating-weighted matching
- [ ] Implement location-based search

### For Team Member C (Payment & Rating):
- [ ] Integrate Razorpay SDK
- [ ] Create payment confirmation screen
- [ ] Enhance review screen UI
- [ ] Add payment history

## üöÄ Commands to Run

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\aakar\AIDkriya\flutter_application_1

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Clean build (if needed)
flutter clean
